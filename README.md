# Challenge 1

Task 1 - Minimalist Application Development / Docker / Kubernetes

To achieve this challenge I have developed the application in python using flask

All the application related files are under /app directory

Steps

- To Containerize the application we should have a Dockerfile
 - First clone the Repository
     
    ```bash
     git clone <repository_link>
     ```
